# (WIP) SSIM Autoencoder

This is an implementation of the following paper: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02011>\
The SSIM index function is an adaption of the DSSIM function provided at <https://github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib/blob/master/keras_contrib/losses/dssim.py>

### Notes:
All the code optimizations are more than welcome!
