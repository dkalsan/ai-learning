# (WIP) SSIM Autoencoder

This is an approximate implementation of the following paper "Improving Unsupervised Defect Segmentation by Applying Structural Similarity to Autoencoders" available at <https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02011>\
The SSIM loss function is cloned from <https://github.com/Po-Hsun-Su/pytorch-ssim>

### Notes:
All the code optimizations are more than welcome!
